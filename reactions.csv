CCl4+H2O(drastic conditions),COCl2+2HCl,SN1 happens only in drastic conditions. Carbene is formed which then reacts with nucleophilic OH-,,Image
NF3+H2O->,no rxn,Under nondrastic conditions SN1 cant happen. SN2 will need low lying empty orbital for flank attack which is absent.,,Image
2HNO2->,NO2+NO+H2O,N2O3 + H2O,,Image
3SiF4+4H2O->,Si(OH)4+2H2[SiF6],SiF4 being highly dq+ and empty d orbital readily complexes into d2sp3. This happens only with F-,,Image
4BF3+3H2O->,H3BO3+3H[BF4],"BF3 being deficient, readily gets complexated to get an octet. This happens only with F- and OH-",Write product in acid form,Image
BCl3+NaOH->,3NaCl+Na[B(OH)4],"Similar to BF3 complexation, Surplus of OH- in solution will complexate deficient molecule.  Same happens with BeCl2, it is a deficient yet small atom too",,Image
NCl3+3H2O->,NH3+3HOCl,"N is more EN than Cl and OH attacks Cl, not N",,Image
SbCl3+H2O->,SbOCl(ppt)+2HCl,Sb has +3 charge since this is ionic and its solubility is bad because of size of Sb,,Image
XeF2+H2O->,2Xe+4HF+O2,"With Xe compounds it is a""Either Go straight to XeO3, ore just become Xe""",,Image
XeF4+H2O->,4Xe+2XeO3+24HF+3O2,"With Xe compounds it is a""Either Go straight to XeO3, ore just become Xe"".",,Image
XeF6+H2O->,XeO3+6HF,"With Xe compounds it is a""Either Go straight to XeO3, ore just become Xe""",,Image
MH+H2O->,MOH+H2,H- will take H+,,Image
TeF6+H2O->,Te(OH)6+6HF,Hydroxides are more stable in predominantly ionic ones. Only dominantly covalent ones will tautomerize/gemdiol eliminate to get =O groups,,Image
SeF6+H2O,H2SeO4+4HF,Hydroxides are more stable in predominantly ionic ones. Only dominantly covalent ones will tautomerize/gemdiol eliminate to get =O groups,Write product in acid form,Image
SF6+H2O,no rxn,S is the smallest one showing 6-covalence. This is highly sterically hindered.,,Image
P4+H2O->,PH3+3H3PO2,Identical treatment is impossible here. Thus it disproportionates unlike regular non-Xe hydrolysis. It can be seen that H3PO4 is not formed but H3PO2 by adding H-OH across rest of the bonds in the other 3 Ps,,Image
Depressant Reactions,ZnS+4NaCN->2Na[Zn(CN)4]+Na2S,Complexing property of Zn is exploited to make ZnS less float-y and settle down,Assume impurity in given ore is Zinc based,Image

Anionic Activation Reaction (Froth Floatation),CuCO3+Na2S->CuS+Na2CO3,"CuS is the best floater. Although it is meant for sulphide ores, other ores can also be concentrated by froth floatation when such reactions are possible.",Assume given ore is Limestone,Text
Leaching Bauxite,Al2O3+2NaOH+3H2O->2Na[Al(OH)4],"Ampho property of Al2O3 and solubility is exploited. Problem with this is that SiO2 which is an acidic oxide, will persist",Write product in complex form,Image
Leaching Silver,Ag2S+4NaCN->2Na[Ag(CN)2]+Na2S,Complexing property of Ag is exploited to precipitate it,,Image
Mond Process,Ni+4CO->[Ni(CO)4]->Ni+4CO,[Ni(CO)4] is volatile and will also thermally decompose once Seperationerated,,Image

Test for CN-,CN+FeSO4+H2SO4(conc)->Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3(Prussian Blue),"Used in Lasagne's organic tests. First complex is formed by Fe2+, then Fe2+ in solution is oxidized by concentrated H2SO4. Alternative to this is to simply add Fe(II) and Fe(III) seperately instead of letting H2SO4 do the oxidation",Use CN instead of CN-. Use typical procedure although several ways are possible. Ignore byproducts for this reaction alone (way too many of them).,Image
NO2 (characteristic description),Reddish Brown Fumes,Appears in group Seperationeration of NO3 and NO2,,Image
S2O3-- Group Seperation,S2O3+H->S8(ppt)+SO2,"S=S bond is not polar and is not hydrolysed like regular S-X bonds. It wont hydrolyse like usual. SO3-- is formed which further gives SO3-- group Seperation. S8 formed is actually colloidal, not ppt.",Ignore any charge in ionic equation,Image
Leaching Gold,4Au+O2+8NaCN->4Na[Au(CN)2]+2Na2O,,,Image
S-- Group Seperation,S+H->H2S(rotten egg),Its good to note that H2S is largely covalent and wont give test for S-- in solution generally,Ignore any charge in equation,Image

CuCl2+H2O+Na2CO3->,"Cu(OH)2.CuCO3(ppt,green)+NaHCO3",,,Image
Ag2SO3(ppt)+▲->,Ag,"Unlike Carbonate, this wont thermal decompose into SO2 but redox into SO4--",Include only the characteristic product.,Image
Ag2S2O3(ppt)+▲->,"Ag2S(ppt,black)","Like SO3--, S2SO3-- acts, except the S= gets taken by Ag this time. Same happens other thiosulphate ppts.",Include only the characteristic product.,Image
Na2S+HNO3->,S8(ppt)+NO2,"Like concentrated HCl and H2SO4, dilute HNO3 can oxidize.",Ignore spectators,Image

S-- Confirmatory,S+Na2[Fe(CN)5NO]->Na4[Fe(CN)5NOS](Purple),"The nitroso attacks S, Thionitrile is an auxophore in the complex.",Use S instead of S--,Image
test for H2SO3,H2SO3+Na2[Fe(CN)5NO]->Na2H2[Fe(CN)5NOSO3](Red),"The nitroso attacks S, an auxophore is formed in the complex.",,Image
S2O3-- Confirmatory,S2O3+KCN+FeCl3->Fe(SCN)3(Blood Red),S-- wont give this reaction as it will redox with FeCl3. [Fe(SCN)(H2O)5]-- gives this Blood Red colour,Use S2O3 instead of S2O3--.Ignore byproducts for this reaction alone (way too many of them).,Image
AcOH+H2SO4(conc)->,CO,"unlike oxalate & Halogens, AcOH will get alpha-dehydrated by conc H2O, not oxidized",Ignore byproducts for this reaction alone,Image

Nessler's Reagant Preparation,"HgI2(ppt,red)+KI->K2[HgI4]",,,Image
NO3- Confirmatory,NO3+H2SO4+FeSO4->[Fe(H2O)5NO](brown ring),high [H+] creates a condition similar to HNO3(conc) and NO is released. NO has an unpaired electron in antibonding and readily donates it to Fe2+ (unlike how Nitroso is formed in diazonium formation). Fe is exceptionally +1 here,Ignore byproducts for this reaction alone,Image
