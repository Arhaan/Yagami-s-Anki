CCl4+H2O(drastic conditions),COCl2+2HCl,SN1 happens only in drastic conditions. Carbene is formed which then reacts with nucleophilic OH-,
NF3+H2O->,no rxn,Under nondrastic conditions SN1 cant happen. SN2 will need low lying empty orbital for flank attack which is absent.,
2HNO2(g)->,NO2+NO+H2O,N2O3 + H2O,
3SiF4+4H2O->,Si(OH)4+2H2[SiF6],SiF4 being highly dq+ and empty d orbital readily complexes into d2sp3. This happens only with F-,
4BF3+3H2O->,H3BO3+3H[BF4],"BF3 being deficient, readily gets complexated to get an octet. This happens only with F- and OH-",Write product in acid form
BCl3+NaOH->,3NaCl+Na[B(OH)4],"Similar to BF3 complexation, Surplus of OH- in solution will complexate deficient molecule.  Same happens with BeCl2, it is a deficient yet small atom too",
NCl3+3H2O->,NH3+3HOCl,"N is more EN than Cl and OH attacks Cl, not N",
SbCl3+H2O->,SbOCl(ppt)+2HCl,Sb has +3 charge since this is ionic and its solubility is bad because of size of Sb,
XeF2+H2O->,2Xe+4HF+O2,"With Xe compounds it is a""Either Go straight to XeO3, ore just become Xe""",
XeF4+H2O->,4Xe+2XeO3+24HF+3O2,"With Xe compounds it is a""Either Go straight to XeO3, ore just become Xe"".",
XeF6+H2O->,XeO3+6HF,"With Xe compounds it is a""Either Go straight to XeO3, ore just become Xe""",
MH+H2O->,MOH+H2,H- will take H+,
TeF6+H2O->,Te(OH)6+6HF,Hydroxides are more stable in predominantly ionic ones. Only dominantly covalent ones will tautomerize/gemdiol eliminate to get =O groups,
SeF6+H2O,H2SeO4+4HF,Hydroxides are more stable in predominantly ionic ones. Only dominantly covalent ones will tautomerize/gemdiol eliminate to get =O groups,Write product in acid form
SF6+H2O,no rxn,S is the smallest one showing 6-covalence. This is highly sterically hindered.,
P4+H2O->,PH3+3H3PO2,Identical treatment is impossible here. Thus it disproportionates unlike regular non-Xe hydrolysis. It can be seen that H3PO4 is not formed but H3PO2 by adding H-OH across rest of the bonds in the other 3 Ps,

Leaching Bauxite,Al2O3+2NaOH+3H2O->2Na[Al(OH)4],"Ampho property of Al2O3 and solubility is exploited. Problem with this is that SiO2 which is an acidic oxide, will persist",Write product in complex form
Leaching Silver,Ag2S+4NaCN->2Na[Ag(CN)2]+Na2S,Complexing property of Ag is exploited to precipitate it,
Mond Process,Ni+4CO->[Ni(CO)4]->Ni+4CO,[Ni(CO)4] is volatile and will also thermally decompose once Seperationerated,

Test for CN-,CN+FeSO4+H2SO4(conc)->Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3(Prussian Blue),"Used in Lasagne's organic tests. First complex is formed by Fe2+, then Fe2+ in solution is oxidized by concentrated H2SO4. Alternative to this is to simply add Fe(II) and Fe(III) seperately instead of letting H2SO4 do the oxidation",Use CN instead of CN-. Use typical procedure although several ways are possible. Ignore byproducts for this reaction (way too many of them).
NO2 (characteristic description),Reddish Brown Fumes,Appears in group Seperationeration of NO3 and NO2,
S2O3-- Group Seperation,S2O3+H->S8(ppt)+SO2,"S=S bond is not polar and is not hydrolysed like regular S-X bonds. It wont hydrolyse like usual. SO3-- is formed which further gives SO3-- group Seperation. S8 formed is actually colloidal, not ppt.",Ignore any charge in ionic equation
Leaching Gold,4Au+O2+8NaCN->4Na[Au(CN)2]+2Na2O,,
S-- Group Seperation,S+H->H2S(rotten egg),Its good to note that H2S is largely covalent and wont give test for S-- in solution generally,Ignore any charge in equation

Nessler's Reagant Preparation,"HgI2(ppt,red)+KI->K2[HgI4]",,
NO3- Confirmatory,NO3+H2SO4+FeSO4->[Fe(H2O)5NO](brown ring),"[H+] creates a condition similar to HNO3 and NO2 is oxidized by HNO3 to NO. NO has an unpaired electron in antibonding and readily donates it to Fe2+ (unlike how Nitroso is formed in diazonium formation). Fe is exceptionally +1 here. This doesnt need concentrated acid unlike NO2-- because these acid must to reduction and it wont disproportionate(not exactly, but qualitatively) like here",Ignore byproducts for this reaction

Add the reagants into reaction in the second step right away (For example like H2O in this reaction: RCHO+KCN->RCH(OH)(CN)+H2O->RCH(OH)COOH)
MnO2 Test for Cl-,2Cl+MnO2+2H2SO4(conc)->Cl2(greenish yellow),This indirectly oxidizes Cl- in salt. Concentrated acid gives HCl which is then oxidized by the oxidizer.,Use Cl instead of Cl-. Ignore byproducts for this reaction.

NH4NO3+▲->,N2O+2H2O,"Exceptionally N2O is formed instead of N2 because this isnt redox although anion is oxidizing, this is just literally removing H2O to give :kekw:-gas",
