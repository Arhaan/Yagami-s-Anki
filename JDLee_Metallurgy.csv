Depressant Reactions,ZnS+4NaCN->2Na[Zn(CN)4]+Na2S,Complexing property of Zn is exploited to make ZnS less float-y and settle down,Assume impurity in given ore is Zinc based
Cationic Activation Reaction (Froth Floatation),ZnS+CuSO4->CuS+ZnSO4,CuS is the best floater,Assume given ore is Zinc Blende
Anionic Activation Reaction (Froth Floatation),CuCO3+Na2S->CuS+Na2CO3,"CuS is the best floater. Although it is meant for sulphide ores, other ores can also be concentrated by froth floatation when such reactions are possible.",Assume given ore is Malachite
Leaching Bauxite,Al2O3+2NaOH+3H2O->2Na[Al(OH)4],"Ampho property of Al2O3 and solubility is exploited. Problem with this is that SiO2 which is an acidic oxide, will persist",Write product in complex form
Leaching Silver,Ag2S+4NaCN->2Na[Ag(CN)2]+Na2S,Complexing property of Ag is exploited to precipitate it,
Mond Process,Ni+4CO->[Ni(CO)4]->Ni+4CO,[Ni(CO)4] is volatile and will also thermally decompose once Seperationerated,
Van Arkel Reaction,M+2I2->MI4->M+2I2,MI4 volatile and also decomposes,Assume the metal is M
Leaching Gold,4Au+O2+8NaCN->4Na[Au(CN)2]+2Na2O,,
